<h1>2010</h1>
<p>
Oracle aquires Sun. The illumos project is started as a fork of OpenSolaris to continue development in the community.
Oracle stops publishing changes to the open source repository, effectively killing OpenSolairs.
<br><br>

<h1>Today</h1>
Over the last 11 years the community has introduced many new features to illumos, including a new bootloader, overlay networks, hardware virtualization (KVM & bhyve), drivers for new hardware and much more.
Contributions come from individual developers and from companies like Joyent / Samsung, Oxide, Nexenta, RackTop, Western Digital, and others.
